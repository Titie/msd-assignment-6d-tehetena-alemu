   Question 1 -
------------------------------
 I suggested they use JSON instead of XML. JSON is readable and easy for application integration. JSON can catch the objects but XML only stuctural part.

The reason JSON is a choice for Restful API integration is :

 => Less verbose : more compact style more readable
 => Faster : Json uses less data over load compared to XML software parsing process that include DOM manipulation
 => Readable: Json structure strightforward and readable. And allow us a fast domain object mapping to any programming languag.
 => Structure matches the data : uses a map data structure, which is predictable and easily understanable data model.
 => Objects align in code which us useful for creating domain objects in dynamic languages.

   Question 2 -
-------------------------------
Yes there is a problem at the login endpoint.

We use HTTP get request. We don't have access to REST API because of access was denied. We provide basic autentication for our rest API well.
However on the Body section we give wrong user name and password.

For this reason, to fix the above reason. I will remove the username and password JSON file from Body section in POST MAN. and I create a GET request for the login endpoint. Set the Authorization header to Basic Authentication with the right username and password. And I press send to test the login end point work as intended.
And I should get a a 200 OK response.
