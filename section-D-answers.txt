   Question 1 -
------------------------------
 I suggested they use JSON instead of XML. JSON is readable and easy for application integration. JSON can catch the objects but XML only stuctural part.

The reason JSON is a choice for Restful API integration is :

 => Less verbose : more compact style more readable
 => Faster : Json uses less data over load compared to XML software parsing process that include DOM manipulation
 => Readable: Json structure strightforward and readable. And allow us a fast domain object mapping to any programming languag.
 => Structure matches the data : uses a map data structure, which is predictable and easily understanable data model.
 => Objects align in code which us useful for creating domain objects in dynamic languages.

   Question 2 -
-------------------------------
It's because at the POST man "GET" HTTP request we have to set username and password for the Body. And means the system marked as Authorization needed.
